In this lab you will learn how to implement a traceroute application using ICMP request and reply
messages. Students are strongly encouraged to first do the ICMP Ping lab before the ICMP Traceroute
lab as it is done with the same approach. The checksum and header making are not covered in this lab,
refer to the ICMP ping lab for that purpose, the naming of most of the variables and socket is also the
same.

Traceroute is a computer networking diagnostic tool which allows a user to trace the route from a host
running the traceroute program to any other host in the world. Traceroute is implemented with ICMP
messages. It works by sending ICMP echo (ICMP type ‘8’) messages to the same destination with
increasing value of the time-to-live (TTL) field. The routers along the traceroute path return ICMP Time
Exceeded (ICMP type ‘11’ ) when the TTL field become zero. The final destination sends an ICMP reply
(ICMP type ’0’ ) messages on receiving the ICMP echo request. The IP addresses of the routers which
send replies can be extracted from the received packets. The round-trip time between the sending host and
a router is determined by setting a timer at the sending host.

Your task is to develop your own Traceroute application in python using ICMP. Your application will use
ICMP but, in order to keep it simple, will not exactly follow the official specification in RFC 1739..

## Additional Notes
1. You do not need to be concerned about the checksum, as it is already given in the code.
2. This lab requires the use of raw sockets. In some operating systems, you may need administrator/root
privileges to be able to run your Traceroute program.
3. See the end of Lab 4 ‘ICMP Pinger’ programming exercise for more information on ICMP.
4. This will not work for websites that block ICMP traffic.
5. You will have to turn your firewall or antivirus software off to allow the messages to be sent and
received.
What to Hand in
You will hand in the complete code and screenshots of your Traceroute output for four different target
hosts.
